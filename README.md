# Hacker Suite

A collection of services and websites to support Hackathons.

We refer to each service/website by 'hs\_' and then the name of the platform.

Currently we have the following:

* [Auth](https://github.com/unicsmcr/hs_auth)
* [Hub](https://github.com/unicsmcr/hs_hub)
* [Applications](https://github.com/unicsmcr/hs_application)

Both the Hub and Applications rely on the Auth service.
